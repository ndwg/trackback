## About trackback
trackback is a web-based game where users guess a track's artist from a short audio clip. Browse through playlists on the main page and click on one of the options to start the game.

This project was inspired by the web series [Track Star*](https://www.youtube.com/@track-star-show) and was developed to be a showcase of my skills in web development, React, and using APIs. Playlist and track data is pulled from the [Deezer API](https://developers.deezer.com/api). The application is hosted at https://www.trackback.uk/.
